Instructions:

Your goal today is to build a "Chose your own adventure game". Using what you have learnt in the lessons today you will be building a very simple version of this type of text game.

Use the flow chart linked [here](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Treasure%20Island%20Conditional.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1oDe4ehjWZipYRsVfeAx2HyB7LCQ8_Fvi%26export%3Ddownload#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22C5RBs43oDa-KdzZeNtuy%22%7D) 
to create the game logic.

Once you've completed the project, you can always extend the game and make it more interesting!
